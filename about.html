        <h1>My Interests</h1>
        <p>I have a strong interest in textiles and design, where I enjoy exploring creativity, experimenting with different techniques, and developing unique projects that reflect both function and style. Beyond the classroom, I am passionate about netball, which allows me to stay active, work as part of a team, and build resilience through competition. I also have a love for travelling, as it provides opportunities to experience new cultures, gain fresh perspectives, and draw inspiration for my creative work. Most importantly, I value spending quality time with family and friends, as it helps me maintain balance, build meaningful connections, and create lasting memories.</p>
